# QuantumComputing
- algorithms and experiments, 
- working with quantum bits (qubits), 
- exploring simulations 

The qubit and the quantum  gate, two fundamental concepts you need to understand to quantum compute. 
I am exploring the Circuit Composer to create a quantum circuit: 
- The state of a qubit
- The quantum NOT gate

Running my circuit on IBM Quantum Experience, and interpreting the results.
